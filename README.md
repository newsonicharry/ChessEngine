This is very much a work in progress

Utilizes bitboards and movement masks for move creation
Uses raylib for gui

Todo:
- Fix all bugs with move validation (never ending bugs, dont expect me to get rid of this soon)
- Check for checkmate, 50 move rule, stalemate and repition (because I somehow havent finished that yet)

Engine:
- Make a custom transposition table
- Finish move ordering
- Add endgames
- Utilize multiprocessing
+ And Much More
